ERC-20 is a popular standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. An ERC-20 snapshot is a record of the distribution of token balances at a specific point in time. This snapshot can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

1. **Airdrops**: An airdrop is a distribution of tokens to a group of addresses. By using an ERC-20 snapshot, token creators can distribute tokens to holders at a specific point in time, based on their token balances.

2. **Rewards**: Token creators can use an ERC-20 snapshot to distribute rewards to token holders based on their token balances. This can be useful for incentivizing holders to keep their tokens for a certain period of time.

3. **Governance**: An ERC-20 snapshot can be used for governance purposes, such as voting on proposals or making decisions based on token holder balances.

4. **Analysis**: Token creators and researchers can use ERC-20 snapshots to analyze token distribution and usage patterns over time.

***ERC-20 snapshots are a useful tool for token creators, developers, and researchers to better understand and manage their token ecosystems.***
