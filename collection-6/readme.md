There is some refactoring design patterns can use in solidity:
- Extract Functions to Improve Modularity
- Split Large Functions into Smaller Ones
- Use Descriptive Names for Variables and Functions
- Remove Unused Code
- Replace Magic Numbers with Constants
- Remove Duplicate Code
- Replace Loops with Mapping
- Use Guard Clauses
- Use Events for Logging
- Use Enumerations for State
- Use Library Functions
- Use Inheritance for Code Reuse
- Use Structs and Arrays for Complex Data

Some information here:

1. Extract Functions to Improve Modularity:\
Extracting functions from a larger function can make the code more modular and easier to understand. Modular code is easier to test and maintain, as each function can be tested and updated independently.

2. Split Large Functions into Smaller Ones:\
Breaking down large functions into smaller ones can make the code easier to understand and maintain. It can also improve performance by reducing the amount of work done in a single function call.

3. Use Descriptive Names for Variables and Functions:\
Using descriptive names for variables and functions can make the code more readable and easier to understand. Functions and variables should have names that accurately reflect their purpose and functionality.

4. Remove Unused Code:\
Removing unused code can improve the performance of the contract by reducing the amount of gas used. It can also make the code easier to read and maintain by removing unnecessary clutter.

5. Replace Magic Numbers with Constants:\
Using constants instead of magic numbers can make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Constants should be used for values that are used repeatedly throughout the contract.

6. Remove Duplicate Code:\
Removing duplicate code can improve the maintainability of the code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be updated when changes are made. It can also make the code more readable by reducing redundancy.

7. Replace Loops with Mapping:\
Using mappings instead of loops can improve the performance of the contract by reducing the amount of work done in a single function call. Mappings can be used to efficiently store and access data.

8. Use Guard Clauses:\
Using guard clauses can simplify the code and make it easier to read. Guard clauses are used to check for error conditions and terminate the function early if necessary.

9. Use Events for Logging:\
Using events to log important actions can make the contract more transparent and easier to debug. Events can be used to log transactions, errors, and other important events.

10. Use Enumerations for State:\
Using enumerations to represent state can make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Enumerations can be used to represent different states of a contract or object.

11. Use Library Functions:\
Using library functions to reuse code can make the code more modular and easier to maintain. Libraries can be used to store commonly used functions that can be reused across multiple contracts.

12. Use Inheritance for Code Reuse:\
Using inheritance to reuse code can make the code more modular and easier to maintain. Inheritance can be used to create a base contract that contains common functionality that can be inherited by other contracts.

13. Use Structs and Arrays for Complex Data:\
Using structs and arrays to organize complex data can make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Structs can be used to define custom data types, while arrays can be used to store collections of data.
